# disqus_crawler
A Chrome extension which pulls comments from a disqus thread and analyzes them

This extension has been made for the ponies (like me) on the site www.equestriadaily.com
Thus, it has been tested almost exclusively on this site. It will most likely not work on other sites

Installation:
Go to chrome://extensions/ in Google Chrome and turn developer mode on
Add an unpacked extension, and select the app folder within this repository
The extension should now be loaded! Go onto EQD, open up a post with a disqus thread, and push the extension icon to analyze its comments


Oh, and FLUTTERSHY IS BEST PONY!
